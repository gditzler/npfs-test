Simple test for NPFS on a synthetic data set. A couple of notes.
* You should have added the `FEAST` library to your Matlab path. 
* You must either modify line 7 (to add `FEAST`) or remove it (if `FEAST` is already there).
* Depending in your computer and Matlab configuration, you may need to remove the parallel computing stuff. 
* I have saved the output from when I ran this on my computer (Mac OS X 10.9.2 running Matlab R2014a).
